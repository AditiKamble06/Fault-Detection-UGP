# Fault-Detection-UGP
This Project mainly deals with building a model which can identify any deviations that could occur during a chemical process. By predicting such abnormalities before they occur, we can decrease the risk of consequences related. The dataset used here is Tennessee Eastman Process dataset and we are trying various ML, DL and Hybrid models here.  
The contributors of this project are Madhu Kumari, Aditi Vishwas Kamble and Piyush Singh.
